                PGFinders is a pioneer in this field. It provides a common platform for students/travellers to scour through numerous PGs and find their perfect match. At the same time it offers a unique feature of free interaction between Finders who are interested in the same PG through a private/public chatroom according to the will of the Finder. This allows comfortable matchmaking between Finders and makes the otherwise cumbersome and complicated process of finding a Flatmate very convenient.

                PGFinders is also a platform that provides a common space for all the PG Owners and brings them together under one umbrella, which otherwise used to be a rather segmented and confusing search for the suitable PG. It expands the public outreach of various PGs and bridges the gap between the confused Finder and the PG owner.
