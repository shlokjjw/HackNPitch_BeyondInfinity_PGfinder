Find your PG now


Conceived from the seed of one great idea , empowering the lonely student or traveller with a humble abode and matchmaking like-minded PG-mates resulting in the hassle-free search for affordable long-term accommodation.
PGFinders is a pioneer in this field. It provides a common platform for students/travellers to scour through numerous PGs and find their perfect match. At the same time it offers a unique feature of free interaction between Finders who are interested in the same PG through a private/public chatroom according to the will of the Finder. This allows comfortable matchmaking between Finders and makes the otherwise cumbersome and complicated process of finding a Flatmate very convenient.
PGFinders is also a platform that provides a common space for all the PG Owners and brings them together under one umbrella, which otherwise used to be a rather segmented and confusing search for the suitable PG. It expands the public outreach of various PGs and bridges the gap between the confused Finder and the PG owner. 
We are small team of young passionate students wishing to the eliminate the woes of numerous confused and overwhelmed students and travellers of finding accommodation and flatmates along with conveniently providing a platform of communication for the PG owners of with like-minded guests. We wish to expand further in the future developing ways to simplify the process even more for our Finders!
